-   Initialized Memory Bank to capture definitive understanding of the Calvary Songs Book API Laravel backend.
-   Documented product positioning, technical architecture, and technology stack for future development cycles.

## Next Steps / Open Items

-   Maintain Memory Bank after significant feature work or architectural changes.
